# vcfsplitter
Splits a bulk vCard file into single vCard files.

# Use case
Thunderbird exports its contacts in one single vCard file (*.vcf*). Sometimes you might want to have one vCard file for each contact instead.

# Usage
- Upload this script to your PHP environment.
- Put the bulk vCard file as `input.vcf` into the `input` folder.
- Open `index.php` in your browser.
- Click "GO" link to start the processing. You might wish to have contact photos removed - in this case, hit "GO (remove contact photos)".
- Get the single vCard files from the `output` folder.
